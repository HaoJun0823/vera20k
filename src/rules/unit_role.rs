//! What a unit is *for*, read out of the rules rather than out of its name.
//!
//! A house that has to plan a squad needs to answer "what is missing" before
//! it answers "which type": too few things that can reach aircraft, too few
//! that can hurt a tank, too few that can deal with a wall of conscripts. The
//! rules already hold the answer to that question — every warhead carries
//! `Verses=` (the damage it does to each of the eleven armour classes) and
//! every projectile carries `AA=`/`AG=` (what it can engage at all) — so the
//! role of a type is a number derived from the same data the damage kernel
//! uses, not a name a player typed into a table.
//!
//! Nothing here is a threshold that decides membership. Every role is a
//! **weight**: a continuous score, scaled against the strongest answer the
//! same rule set has for that job, so a mod that rewrites the warheads, adds
//! an armour class or retunes damage reshapes the weights without anyone
//! revisiting a constant. A type carries several at once and the caller
//! decides what to do with them — `RoleWeights` is deliberately dumb
//! arithmetic, and the strategy layer owns the part that says "we are short of
//! anti-air".
//!
//! Scaling is per role, not per table: `1.0` means "the best answer this rule
//! set offers for that job", so a need for anti-air counts for as much as a
//! need for anti-tank even where only two types can reach the sky.
//!
//! This is a derived cache, not simulation state: it is built once from a
//! finished [`RuleSet`] and never changes.
