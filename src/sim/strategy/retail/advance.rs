//! Sending the army out.
//!
//! Native carries the attack in teams: an `AITrigger` creates one and its
//! script assigns the missions. A brain-driven house never gets an `AITrigger`
//! — `HouseClass::Update`'s team block is gated on "no human controls it" —
//! so without this module its army sits on area guard for the whole match and
//! the house can only lose by attrition.
//!
//! This is the player's substitute, and deliberately two rules. The first is
//! *when*: an army large enough to be worth spending, heavy enough to beat what
//! is standing where it is going ([`super::squads::outguns`]), a base that can
//! replace it, and nothing already at the yard. The second is *where*: one structure
//! for the whole army — the enemy economy structure nearest the first fighter
//! in entity-store order — because a fist takes a base, and units that walk
//! at their own nearest building arrive one at a time and die one at a time.
//!
//! One goal for the army is a measurement, not a preference. Three variants
//! were run end to end against the pinned `Death.mmx` match and all three
//! lost the push the current rule wins: aiming each unit at the structure its
//! own weapons answer best, aiming the fist from the army's centre instead of
//! that first fighter, and holding one target until it is destroyed instead
//! of re-reading the nearest one each frame (`super::RESIDUALS` has the
//! ticks). So the *target* stays one, and what differs per unit is the
//! **order**: a unit already inside its own weapon's reach of that structure
//! attacks it from where it stands, and one further out attack-moves toward
//! it. That keeps the fist together — the failure the three variants shared
//! was dispersion, not per-unit decisions — while stopping the army from
//! walking its short-ranged units point-blank into a base to shoot at all.
//!
//! While it is pushing it owns the whole army, so the area-guard step stands
//! down for the frame; a house that has not got an army yet keeps holding its
//! base, which is what a player does with five tanks and no plan.
