//! What the army does *this second*: the layer between a team's target and a
//! unit's mission.
//!
//! The teams above decide where the army goes. What they do not decide, and
//! what a player decides continuously, is what each unit shoots on the way:
//! an army told to walk at a base and nothing else walks past the tanks
//! sitting between it and that base, because the fight was never its order —
//! the walk was. That is the whole of "the push is dense and blind", and it is
//! not fixed by choosing a better target: it is fixed by asking, every second
//! and per unit, what is in reach *now*.
//!
//! So the cycle here is short ([`super::tracked::MICRO_FRAMES`], a second) and
//! its answers override a march rather than being overridden by one: a unit
//! whose reach already holds a hostile is told to shoot it, and the march is
//! re-decided when the shooting is over. The intent it records is
//! [`TrackedKind::Engage`], whose term is one cycle — long enough that the
//! order is not re-sent every frame, short enough that a unit which has
//! finished fighting is the march's again inside a second.
//!
//! The rest of the layer is what each role does when nothing is in reach: a
//! defender walks at the raid, a scout walks where it can see what the enemy is
//! doing. The fist is left alone — the advance step owns it.
//!
//! Determinism: the ledger's own order, squared integer distances, id
//! tie-breaks.
