//! What the production lines make: the house's target shape, and the type each
//! idle factory starts next.
//!
//! The old rule here ranked types by *summed* role weight, so one IFV's
//! anti-air, anti-infantry and anti-armour weights together answered a tank and
//! a conscript at once, `shortfall` came back empty, and the fallback — the
//! dearest type in the thinnest price band — bought the same IFV forever. That
//! is the "one type deep" army a play test reports. This module counts instead:
//! how many of the house's units can actually do each job
//! ([`Census::able`]) against how many of the enemy's units ask for it
//! ([`Census::threat`]), and it holds the infantry share to a floor, so the
//! barracks is a line that fires rather than one that stands idle.
//!
//! Every idle line is filled, including the aircraft and the naval ones: a
//! house that owns a factory of a category and never uses it has paid for
//! nothing.
//!
//! Determinism: integer comparisons over the rules' arrays in their own order,
//! with the role arithmetic (`f64`) used as a comparison only — the same
//! contract [`crate::rules::unit_role`] states for its weights.
