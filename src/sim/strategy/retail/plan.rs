//! The build list, and the wallet that pays for it.
//!
//! What the base builds is one ordered list, read top to bottom, and what it
//! may spend is the wallet minus what the lines have already been promised.
//! Those were one question before this module: the order was a chain of
//! conditions, each one reading the wallet of the moment, and a queue is
//! money the wallet has not been charged for yet — a build starts owing its
//! `Cost_Of` and pays it down as it steps (`sim::production::factory`), so
//! queuing costs the house nothing today. The same credits were therefore
//! spent twice: a structure was started with money the army had already been
//! promised, and the wallet never got to the price of a tank.
//!
//! Three numbers come out of here:
//!
//! - **What the house earns per minute**, measured: two samples of
//!   [`Observation::earned`] a window apart. It is what turns the list into a
//!   budget — a structure that costs a minute's income is a decision, not a
//!   reflex, and the log line the brain writes every ten seconds says how the
//!   house is doing rather than only what it holds.
//! - **What is still free**: the wallet minus [`Census::committed`], the
//!   money no line has been promised yet. Every gate below reads that and
//!   none of them reads the balance.
//! - **Whether the base is short of power**, counting the plants still
//!   building at the output they will have when they finish
//!   ([`power_short`]). A plant under construction supplies its `Power=`
//!   scaled by the health it has built, while everything it feeds draws in
//!   full — read naively that is a brownout for as long as the plant is
//!   being built, and the answer it produced was a second plant: the opening
//!   became two plants and one refinery.
//!
//! Determinism: integer arithmetic over the rules' arrays in their own order,
//! and the meter is a ring of samples keyed by the frame they were taken at,
//! so the same replay gives the same rate.
