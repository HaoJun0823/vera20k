//! The retail brain: the orders and intents a player's hands would produce,
//! for whichever house the control layer drives.
//!
//! It is a player's brain, not the computer AI's. The house it drives is a
//! human house: `HouseClass::Update`'s AI blocks — the base plan, the
//! choosers, the team creation and the strategy tick — are gated on "no human
//! controls it" and never run for it, and this brain does not make them run.
//! So everything here is a command a player could have issued: a deploy, a
//! build, a placement, an order on one of the house's own objects.
//!
//! Three jobs, in this order each frame:
//!
//! - **Get a base started**: deploy the MCV, so the yard exists to build
//!   from, and buy another one back when the yard is gone ([`expand`]).
//! - **Spend the money**: place what the yard has finished, start the next
//!   structure, keep the factories on harvesters, then on what the house's own
//!   teams asked for (`Suggest_New_Object`'s slot) and finally on what the army
//!   is short of ([`build`], over the job weights in `rules::unit_role`). That
//!   module holds the economy; it is this brain's own, because the native one
//!   is a computer house's and comes with money the house has not earned.
//! - **Use what it has**: an engineer repairs the bridge whose hut is down at
//!   home or takes a building it may capture, a spy walks into the building
//!   worth most, a rifleman garrisons a building near the base, an army large
//!   enough is sent at the enemy's base ([`advance`]), and while it is not, an
//!   idle combat unit holds the base ([`orders`]).
//!
//! Determinism: the brain owns its generator and never draws from a
//! simulation stream, and every decision is an integer comparison over the
//! rules' arrays and the entity store in their own order.
//!
//! RESIDUALS:
//! - The push is one rule: army size, then the nearest enemy structure. It
//!   has no retreat, no regrouping and no wave timing, so a push that is
//!   losing keeps going. Each unit's actual fight is the sim's `AttackMove`
//!   and `Guard`.
//! - The detour ([`avoidance`]) is two legs of geometry, not a path search: it
//!   does not know a wall, so a corner behind one is refused and the unit walks
//!   its march instead, and with no gap between two guns it stands at the edge
//!   of the nearer one rather than finding a way through. The local fight it
//!   weighs is a sum of `Strength=`, so armour, warheads and what a turret can
//!   bring to bear are not in the comparison. Aircraft and dug-in units are
//!   left out: neither walks a route this pass could change.
//! - Who fights, measured (`autoplay-match --dump-teams`, pinned
//!   `Death.mmx`/`0x5eed`): this house never has a native `TeamClass` at all —
//!   `HouseClass::Update`'s team block is gated on the house not being human
//!   (`ai_team_creation::update_team_creation`), which is native behaviour and
//!   stays. The computer house does get teams, and their retail scripts run
//!   (action ids 54/58/5 were observed mid-match), but only about two at a
//!   time and roughly ten of its units are in them; none of its 165
//!   `AITriggerTypes` produced a completed team by tick 6000. So on this side
//!   this brain is the whole army, and no unit of ours is ever inside a team
//!   for the native script and this module to fight over.
//! - Three push variants were built, run end to end and reverted, because
//!   each lost the match the current rule wins at tick 25636: per-unit targets
//!   matched to a structure's defenders by `unit_role` weights (timeout at
//!   36000, enemy still at 4), the fist aimed from the army's own centre
//!   instead of its first fighter (timeout, enemy 4), and one target held
//!   until destroyed (timeout, enemy 11). The push is sensitive to the exact
//!   target sequence, so a change here needs a better model of *why* the
//!   current sequence works before it can be replaced. The **order** is the
//!   part that was changed since: the fist keeps one target, and each unit is
//!   told to attack it from where it stands when the structure is already
//!   inside its own weapon's reach, and to attack-move otherwise. That is not
//!   one of the three: the failure they shared was dispersion.
//! - Only one managed routine is attached: `Retreat`, for a fighting unit
//!   under a third of its strength. `AirSplit` and `SpyApproach` are not,
//!   and the reason is the same for both — a routine that is its object's
//!   only issuer would take an aircraft off the push and a spy off the
//!   [`orders`] capture step, and the attach request carries no preference to
//!   put in their place. Both need the request to carry a target before they
//!   can be engaged without regressing the push.
//! - The ledger ([`census`]) is rebuilt every frame rather than cached across
//!   frames: a cached count that lags the entity store is a decision made on
//!   a stale army. The vectors keep their capacity, so a steady army costs no
//!   allocation; the cost is one walk of the entity store and one of each
//!   house's factories per frame.
//! - The army sees the whole map: fog honesty is still the open question
//!   `docs/autoplay.md` records. So does the purchase: the enemy's composition
//!   is read past the fog, and `unit_role` reads a type's warheads rather than
//!   the armour it will actually meet, so a type's range against the enemy's
//!   and what a turret can bring to bear are not in the ranking yet.
//! - Target selection is one predicate, not the native one: another house's
//!   object this house is at war with, nearest first, and only inside the
//!   base radius.
//! - A yard rebuilt from a bought MCV is not defended differently from the
//!   first one, and the brain does not repair a damaged structure, so a raid
//!   that reaches the base can take it a second time.
//! - A hurt unit reaching a `UnitRepair=` bay is now the bay's: the retreat
//!   clicks it (Enter on the building, the player's own order) instead of
//!   walking at its cell, so the dock, the paid heal and the release are the
//!   sim's own chain. What is still ours is the judgement around it: the unit
//!   is held out of the push while it is under a third of its strength, and the
//!   bay's release walks it out on
//!   its own (`building_dock::release_contact`), so a unit healed back over the
//!   line is simply read as healthy next frame. Nothing re-forms it into a
//!   squad; the squads regroup on their own term.
//! - With no building left standing, `advance` has no base centre to measure,
//!   and reads the house as not under threat, so the push runs: an army is the
//!   only thing such a house has. What it does not do is rebuild — the maker
//!   it needs can still be refused by `CanBuild`, and the recovery chain in
//!   [`expand`] cannot run without a factory to buy it from.
