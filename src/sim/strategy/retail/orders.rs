//! The army's direct orders, for the units no team has taken: an idle combat
//! unit goes on area guard, an engineer walks into the bridge hut whose span is
//! down or into a building it may capture, a spy walks into the building worth
//! most, an `Occupier=` rifleman garrisons a building near the base, and an
//! idle scout detours for a crate it can walk to.
//!
//! Each is a click the player already has, issued as the same command: the
//! Capture click (engineers, spies, bridge huts, garrisons) and the Enter click
//! (docking a vehicle into a depot). Nothing here decides what a click *does* —
//! `InfantryClass::PerCellProcess`, `BuildingClass::CanBeOccupiedBy` and the
//! entry queries own that.
//!
//! Native teams carry the attack. An `AITrigger` creates a team, its script
//! assigns missions, and `team_script_vm` writes them onto the members. Those
//! missions have no player equivalent, and a team's script already runs for a
//! brain-driven house, so this module only covers **the units no team has
//! taken**: an idle one goes on area guard where it stands, and the sim's own
//! Guard mission decides what it engages and where it returns to. That is the
//! native posture for a unit no team has taken — it sits, it does not charge,
//! and it is the sim, not this module, that picks its fight.
//!
//! Sending every idle unit at the nearest hostile instead is what a play test
//! loses with: the opening squad walks into the enemy's own pre-placed force
//! and dies, the plan loses the units it was going to recruit, and the base
//! keeps spending on replacements it cannot afford.
//!
//! That leaves the offensive half to the teams, which is where the retail AI
//! puts it: a hostile the enemy owns is what an `AITrigger` needs, and the
//! enemy search that sets it runs in the house's own Strategy tick
//! (`sim::house_strategy`), which the brain asks for.
//!
//! Every order here passes through [`super::tracked`], which remembers what
//! each unit has been told and refuses to say it again until the intent has
//! expired, has changed, or its target has moved. That is what keeps a toggle
//! from undoing itself and a walk-in from being restarted every frame — and
//! what keeps the whole per-frame budget from going on one army's standing
//! orders.
//!
//! Every order that names an object also passes through [`admits`], which asks
//! the simulation whether this unit can act on that object at all: the same
//! `GetFireError` / `What_Action_OnObject` answer the player's click gets. The
//! brain aims units at what the house can see, not at what the unit can do, so
//! without that door a dog is walked to a tank its jaw cannot touch and an
//! engineer to a building that answers Repair — both refused on arrival, both
//! read as a stuck unit.
