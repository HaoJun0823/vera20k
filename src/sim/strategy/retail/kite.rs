//! Fire and move: shoot, step out while the gun reloads, come back when it is
//! loaded, and do it around whatever can actually shoot back.
//!
//! The cycle is one frame's arithmetic, not a state machine:
//!
//! - the gun is **ready** and the target is inside the unit's reach: nothing to
//!   say. The micro pass issues the `Attack` and the unit fires where it stands;
//!   the native mission closes the last cells by itself.
//! - the gun is ready and the target is **outside** the reach: the `Attack` is
//!   issued from here, because a kite that walked itself out of its own range
//!   has to be the one that walks back in — the micro pass only looks at what
//!   is already in reach.
//! - the gun is **reloading**: the unit takes one step away from the enemies
//!   that can reach it *where it stands*, and only from those. That is the
//!   difference between a kite and a rout: a tank that is out of its own range
//!   is not a reason to move, and a building the unit is shooting at is not a
//!   reason either.
//!
//! The step is chosen to leave the nearest reachable enemy as far as possible
//! while staying as close to the unit's own target as the choice allows, so a
//! unit with a tank on its left steps right and keeps the building it was
//! attacking in front of it. Ties break by a fixed direction order, never by
//! hash order.
//!
//! Nothing here remembers the band or the cycle: readiness, distance and the
//! enemies in reach are all read from the world every frame, which is what
//! makes the pass survive a target that dies, a gun that never reloads, and a
//! unit that is re-tasked mid-cycle.
