//! Getting a base started: deploy the yard maker, and buy another one when the
//! yard is gone.
//!
//! `UnitClass::Deploy` (`0x007393C0`) is the AI's own route to a base — the
//! house's MCV becomes a Construction Yard, and the Recalc that follows anchors
//! the plan on it. A brain-driven house receives no player click, so the brain
//! issues the same deploy the click would.
//!
//! A yard is also a structure like any other, so it can be destroyed, and every
//! structure in `[AI] BuildRefinery=`/`BuildWeapons=`/`BuildBarracks=` hangs off
//! it through `Prerequisite=` (`HouseClass::CanBuild` @ `0x004F7870`: a human
//! house needs the entry on the map). Losing it is not a lost base yet — the
//! factories still produce and the army still fights — but nothing new can be
//! started, so a player buys another MCV out of the war factory, which is the
//! only type that carries `DeploysInto=` back to the yard.
//!
//! Beyond that first yard, a house that is earning more than it can spend
//! builds another: it buys a maker out of the war factory, walks it away from
//! the base it has, and deploys it there. That is a second `BuildConst=`
//! structure, and the placement sweep, the build list and the walls all read
//! it as one — there is no second ledger for it.
