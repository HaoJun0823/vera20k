//! Walls around the buildings that are worth more than the wall.
//!
//! What gets walled is the retail data's own answer: `ProtectWithWall=yes`
//! marks a BuildingType the computer may wall in
//! (`BuildingTypeClass ReadINI 0x0046026B..0x0046027F`), and retail sets it on
//! exactly the objects a house cannot afford to lose — the Construction Yard,
//! the tech lab and the superweapons. The same key drives
//! `sim::ai_base_building`'s site border, so a mod that marks a building is
//! walled without a name list here.
//!
//! Two limits come from the engine rather than from the data:
//!
//! - A wall is a `Wall=yes` BuildingType with a one-cell foundation
//!   (`[GAWALL] Adjacent=8`, `Cost=100`, `BuildCat=Combat`), built out of the
//!   **Defense** line, not the yard's building queue. One segment in the queue
//!   is not one cell on the map: `MapClass588750 @ 0x00588750` scans the four
//!   cardinal directions from the cell a wall lands on and constructs every
//!   cell between it and this house's own wall within `GuardRange`
//!   ([`crate::sim::production::wall_placement`]). A straight run is therefore
//!   closed by placing its two ends, the way a player drags one down a line,
//!   and it costs two slots rather than one per cell.
//! - A wall blocks its owner's units as well, and retail has no gate this house
//!   can build, so the ring is closed all the way round except one cell on the
//!   side away from the enemy ([`gate_cell`]): that is where the yard's own
//!   units come and go, and one cell is the smallest hole an attack can use. A
//!   half-ring — the enemy-facing arc alone — is not a wall: it leaves three
//!   sides of a captured lab open, which is what "the base is only half
//!   enclosed" looks like on the map.
//!
//! The result is a segment plan, not a picture: the next cell to fill is
//! computed from the base as it stands, so a wall that was interrupted, a
//! building that died, or a base that grew all answer the next question
//! correctly without a stored plan to go stale.
