//! What each unit has already been told, and when it may be told again.
//!
//! Every other layer here answers "what should this unit do"; this one answers
//! "does it need telling". Those are different questions, and the second one
//! is where this brain was wrong: it re-decided for every unit every frame and
//! sent the answer again, so a command was issued once per frame for as long
//! as the decision stood.
//!
//! That is invisible for a command that sets a destination, and it is a bug
//! for the two kinds that are not: a **toggle** (the D key flips the pose, so a
//! second press undoes the first) and one whose **state lags the command** (a
//! deploying soldier still reads as standing until the animation finishes, so a
//! step that re-reads the state toggles it straight back up). Both were being
//! patched one at a time — a refresh timer here, a cooldown there — and the
//! garrison, which has neither, was re-issued every frame.
//!
//! One owner now holds the answer: an intent is recorded when it is issued,
//! and a layer that asks for the same one is refused until one of three things
//! is true —
//!
//! - **it expired** (each kind gets its own term: a deploy animation is short,
//!   a walk across the map is long);
//! - **the intent changed** (a different kind, or a different target);
//! - **the target moved** past [`REISSUE_CELLS`], which is the case an expiry
//!   alone cannot see: a unit walking at a target that has itself walked away
//!   is still holding a valid-looking intent.
//!
//! The third is why this is a record of *what was said* rather than a timer:
//! the world moves under the order, and only the order's own target knows when
//! it has moved far enough to be worth repeating.
//!
//! Determinism: `BTreeMap` keyed by the unit id, integer frame and integer
//! squared-distance comparisons only.
