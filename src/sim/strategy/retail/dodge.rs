//! Stepping out of the way of a shot that is already in the air.
//!
//! This is the one micro decision that has to be made inside a bullet's flight
//! time, so it runs on its own clock instead of the fifteen-frame micro cycle:
//! a shell crosses a cell in a handful of frames and a unit needs ten to twenty
//! to cross one itself. Everything below is arithmetic on the frame the
//! question is asked, and the only memory is the intent that stops the same
//! step being re-issued every frame ([`TrackedKind::Dodge`]).
//!
//! What can be dodged is what the bullet type says, not what the AI wishes:
//!
//! - `Inviso=` bullets are placed on the target and land the same frame
//!   (`BulletClass::Fire 0x004688B7`): `frames == 0`, no decision.
//! - `ROT >= 1` bullets re-read the live position every visit
//!   (`Projectile::tracks_target`): leaving the impact cell changes nothing, so
//!   they are ignored rather than strafed against.
//! - An ordinary `ROT < 1` bullet keeps the point it was fired at
//!   (`initial_target_position`): that frozen aim is the mechanic a step aside
//!   exploits, and it is why a target that has walked away is not there when
//!   the shell lands.
//!
//! The feasibility test is the physics the engine already has: the unit's own
//! `Speed=` converted exactly as `TechnoType ReadINI` does (`speed * 256 / 100`
//! leptons a frame), the bullet's current lepton speed, and the warhead's
//! `CellSpread=` as the radius the impact still hurts in. A step is ordered only
//! when the unit can leave that radius before the shot lands: a dodge that
//! arrives late is a wasted order and a unit out of position.
