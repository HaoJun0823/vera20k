//! Walking around a fight that cannot be won.
//!
//! [`super::dodge`] steps out of a shell already in the air and [`super::kite`]
//! spends a reload outside the enemy's reach; both take it for granted that the
//! unit is standing where it should be. This pass owns the question underneath
//! them: **is the ground ahead worth walking onto?**
//!
//! Two things make a unit walk into its own grave, and neither is a target
//! choice. A defence structure outranges and outweighs a lone soldier, so the
//! march to the enemy's base crosses its guns one unit at a time; and a group of
//! hostiles that outweighs what stands here turns the same march into a trade
//! the house loses. Both look identical from the outside — units walking
//! straight into fire — and both are decided *before* a shot is fired, which is
//! why no pass that starts from a shot in the air can fix them.
//!
//! So the test is a local one, in the same currency the rest of the brain
//! compares armies in ([`fight_points`]): the hit points of what this unit can
//! see near it against the hit points of what can see it. With the local fight
//! lost ([`outmatched`]) the unit does not walk in; it is routed around the
//! threat instead. That is the whole rule, and it is deliberately local: the
//! army's own push is the `outguns` gate's business ([`super::squads`]), and a
//! column that outnumbers the guns walks straight through them.
//!
//! The route is two legs of pure geometry, re-derived from where the unit
//! stands every time it is asked — never remembered:
//!
//! 1. **out**: while the unit is inside the threat's band, walk sideways to
//!    the band's edge. `CellSpread` and weapon reach are boxes in this game
//!    (Chebyshev, as [`super::kite`] measures them), so leaving the band is one
//!    straight walk that cannot be interrupted by the thing being avoided.
//! 2. **past**: once outside the band, walk forward past the threat at the
//!    clearance already gained.
//!
//! The other thing that stops a walk is not a gun at all, and it is the one a
//! player never thinks about because a player sees it: **a wall across the
//! road**. A `Wall=yes` overlay is ground a walker cannot enter, so a march
//! ordered across it is a march that never arrives — the objective on the far
//! side is unreachable and the unit spends the rest of the order standing in
//! front of it. Retail has an AI answer here only because the player has one:
//! the same road is opened the same two ways, **around** ([`way_around`]) when
//! the barrier is a segment, and **through** when it is a ring — the
//! force-fire click on the cell, the one the garage door in a base is opened
//! with.
//!
//! Because the leg is a function of the unit's own position, the pass has no
//! state machine to fall out of: the leg changes when the position does, and
//! when the objective stops being covered by the threat the pass says nothing
//! at all and the unit's own march is left alone.
//!
//! What it applies to is every walking unit, not just the ones with a gun: an
//! engineer on its way to a derrick and a dog sent to look are routed around a
//! pillbox exactly like a rifleman. Fighters stand their ground — a unit on
//! `Attack`, `Guard` or `AreaGuard` is not walking anywhere, and a dug-in
//! position is a position worth holding — and a unit whose capture, garrison or
//! deploy routine owns it is that routine's.
//!
//! Determinism: the sweep is bounded and rotates the ledger (the units at the
//! end of it would otherwise never be looked at), squares are integer
//! comparisons, the side of the detour is read from the unit's own position,
//! and ties break by entity id.
