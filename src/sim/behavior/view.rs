//! What one executing object may look at: its own state, and the threats
//! around it.
//!
//! [`ObjectView`] is a projection, not a handle: it copies the fields an
//! execution behaviour decides on and is cheap to build. [`ThreatView`] is a
//! borrowed, radius-limited enemy query; it allocates nothing and reads the
//! house alliance graph the game already keeps, so "enemy" means what it means
//! everywhere else (`sim::house_diplomacy`, `MultiplayPassive` houses
//! excluded).
//!
//! Neither type writes anything. An execution behaviour that wants to act
//! returns a [`super::goal::Goal`]; [`super::order`] is the only writer path.
