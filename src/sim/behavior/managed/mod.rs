//! Managed execution: a small phase machine per object, stepped by the control
//! layer.
//!
//! **These routines are not native behaviour and do not claim parity.** They
//! exist so a policy-driven house can pull a hurt unit out of a fight, walk a
//! spy around a patrol or spread an aircraft flight's fire — micro a player
//! performs by hand and neither `gamemd`'s computer AI nor VERA's retail brain
//! issues. They are enabled only for a house the retail brain drives, never for
//! a scenario's own AI house, and no golden or native comparison covers them.
//!
//! A routine is a **pure function of `(me, world, phase)`**. It owns no state:
//! the phase lives in the control layer's table
//! ([`crate::sim::control::micro`]), so replaying the same inputs against the
//! same phase produces the same step, and nothing here reads a clock, an `f32`
//! or an unordered container. That invariant is what keeps managed mode out of
//! the simulation's authoritative state and out of its checksum: a routine's
//! only output is a [`Goal`] or a wait, and the goal travels the ordinary
//! command stream.
//!
//! Adding a routine is one file, one [`MicroKind`] variant and one arm in
//! [`MicroKind::routine`]; no other module changes.
