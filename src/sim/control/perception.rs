//! What the house can see, and what it remembers having seen.
//!
//! The census reads every enemy on the map. A player sees what the shroud
//! shows and remembers the last place an object was when it went out of sight;
//! the difference is the whole of "the AI cheats", and switching the census off
//! without a memory behind it is a brain that forgets a base the moment a
//! rifleman walks past it.
//!
//! This is that memory, and it is deliberately a separate owner from the
//! census: the census answers "what exists", this answers "what is known".
//! `AUTOPLAY_HONEST=1` swaps the brain's enemy list for this one; the default
//! keeps the omniscient list while the policy is moved onto it.
//!
//! Staleness is a frame budget, not a fade: an object seen at `t` is a fact
//! about `t` only, and after [`MEMORY_FRAMES`] it is forgotten rather than
//! tracked with an invented position. A remembered object keeps the cell it
//! was seen at — the honest answer is "it was here", never "it is here".
