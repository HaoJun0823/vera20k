//! The control board: the one place a frame's requests become commands.
//!
//! Per frame, in this order:
//!
//! 1. the brain **thinks** against a fresh projection and answers orders and
//!    intents;
//! 2. what a factory has finished is taken out of it, so a finished build
//!    never blocks its own category;
//! 3. attached objects are stepped — garbage-collected, then the rotation for
//!    this frame — and each routine's answer becomes a goal;
//! 4. every order and intent is admitted: domain switch, per-frame budget, the
//!    acting object's ownership and the native order gate;
//! 5. what survived is stamped with the house and the current tick and queued
//!    through `Simulation::queue_commands`, the append-only ingress a player's
//!    clicks use.
//!
//! Step 4 is why this layer exists: the same admission applies to a retail
//! brain, a script and a managed routine, and a refusal is *counted and
//! reported*, never silent. A unit that stops is either waiting on a native
//! transition (`NotReady`) or has left the house's control (rejected), and the
//! counters say which.
//!
//! Nothing above this file may issue a command on its own — that is the whole
//! contract. The board writes no simulation state except through the owners it
//! calls, and owns no gameplay rule.
