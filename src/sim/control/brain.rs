//! The decision port: what a brain is, and the box it answers into.
//!
//! The contract is declared here, on L2's side, so the dependency arrow points
//! one way only: a brain is something L2 drives, and L2 never names a concrete
//! brain. [`crate::sim::strategy`] implements it; an external controller can
//! implement it too without touching anything else (see
//! [`super::external`]).
//!
//! A brain is **read-only over the simulation**. It sees
//! [`Observation`](super::observation::Observation), returns
//! [`Order`](super::intent::Order)s and [`Intent`](super::intent::Intent)s, and
//! writes nothing: the control layer applies what it asks for through the
//! owning modules, in one place, with one admission rule. That is what lets a
//! second brain — a script, a replay, a network — drop in without a second
//! implementation of "may I issue this".
