//! Per-frame budgets: how many commands may leave, how many objects may be
//! stepped, and where the rotation starts.
//!
//! A house can own twenty thousand objects. Without a budget the frame would
//! spend itself on orders that are never drained, and the host's own per-frame
//! cap (kept from the previous design, `docs/autoplay.md`) would silently drop
//! the tail. So the budget is taken *before* a command is built, not after: an
//! issuer that gets no slot learns it was rejected instead of believing an
//! order it never issued.
//!
//! The rotation cursor makes the micro table fair without a queue: each frame
//! starts where the last one stopped, so every attached object is stepped
//! eventually and the per-frame cost is flat.

/// One frame's allowance.
