//! Where a finished building goes: the native site first, a bounded sweep as
//! the fallback.
//!
//! The native answer is `HouseClass::FindBaseBuildingSite` (`0x005060B0`,
//! [`crate::sim::ai_base_site::find_base_building_site`]) — the same search the
//! computer AI makes before it places a structure. It keys off the house's base
//! reservation and plan centre, so for a house that has played as a player (no
//! `+0x5750` plan centre, and a reservation that may be empty) it can answer
//! "no site" or a cell the sidebar's build area refuses.
//!
//! Hence the second half. When the native search gives nothing admissible, the
//! sweep walks outwards from the house's Construction Yard and then its other
//! structures — ring by ring, in a fixed order — and returns the `attempt`-th
//! cell the placement gate admits. That is a policy choice, not a port, and it
//! is recorded as such: a human house has no native plan centre to ask, and the
//! retail game never needs this path because a human clicks. The `attempt`
//! parameter is how the caller moves on after the receiver refuses a cell.
