//! The two things a brain may ask for, and where each one is applied.
//!
//! - [`Order`]: one object, one [`Goal`]. Translated by the L1 funnel into the
//!   command a click would produce, then admitted and queued.
//! - [`Intent`]: house-scoped work — a build, a placement, a sale — that a
//!   player's hands do through the sidebar rather than by clicking the map.
//!
//! Both are *requests*. Naming them separately from
//! [`Command`](crate::sim::command::Command) is the point of the layer: a brain
//! says what it wants, L2 decides whether the house may issue it now and which
//! native owner performs it. Production, placement, sale and the queue each
//! keep exactly one owner — this module holds no state of its own and
//! re-implements none of them.
//!
//! Every request is a command. A brain never asks the simulation to hold
//! state that is not a player's own doing: a player's hands cannot raise an AI
//! team or run a house's AI tick, so neither is a request here, and this layer
//! applies nothing through a module of its own.
