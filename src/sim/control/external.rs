//! The reserved external-control seam: a versioned observation batch and a
//! batched action answer.
//!
//! **Nothing here transports anything.** There is no socket, no shared memory,
//! no `net` dependency and no scheduling: this module fixes the *contract* an
//! out-of-process controller would speak, so that wiring one later changes no
//! other module. [`PolicySource`] is the place a learned policy or a remote
//! script would plug in, beside [`super::brain::Brain`] rather than inside it.
//!
//! The shape is chosen for machine learning:
//!
//! - one **fixed-length integer tensor** per frame, so a batch is a plain array
//!   with no parsing and no allocation per feature;
//! - rows ordered by stable entity id, so row `r` names the same object on both
//!   sides of the wire;
//! - one **version** covering the whole layout. A version change is a breaking
//!   change: a controller pinned to an older version must be rejected rather
//!   than adapted, because silently shifting a feature column would corrupt a
//!   trained model;
//! - actions as **slots** — `(row, goal, target row, cell)` — so a policy can
//!   answer for many entities in one call instead of one call per unit.
//!
//! Determinism: a batch is built from the same integer state the in-process
//! brain reads, in the same order, so replaying a command stream reproduces the
//! batches that produced it. That is what makes an externally driven match
//! recordable at all.
//!
//! Residual: no batch is built unless a [`PolicySource`] is installed, so this
//! module costs a normal match nothing.
