//! The managed table: which objects run a routine, and its phase.
//!
//! **This state is not simulation state.** It never enters a snapshot, a
//! checksum or a replay: a replay reproduces it from the same command stream
//! and the same rules, because every routine is a pure function of
//! `(object, threats, phase)` and the phase is advanced only by stepping. What
//! the table decides reaches the world exclusively as commands. The header of
//! [`crate::sim::behavior::managed`] states the same invariant from the other
//! side; a test replays an identical sequence into two tables and compares them
//! step for step.
//!
//! Lifecycle is L2's: an entry is dropped when its object dies, leaves the map,
//! is captured, boards a transport or is mind-controlled, and when a team script
//! takes it over — a team's members already have an issuer, and two issuers
//! would overwrite each other's orders (`TeamClass::Recruit` clears the
//! member's target).
