//! L2's read-only projection, scoped to one house: what that house's player
//! sees.
//!
//! The decision layer reads the game only through this type, so its whole
//! information set is one documented surface with one owner. It is a borrow, not
//! a snapshot: nothing is copied or retained, and a decision that needs a value
//! across frames holds the value, not the view.
//!
//! The surface is `pub` and not crate-only because the layer above is the
//! consumer these queries exist for: a `pub(crate)` hook is a hook only this
//! crate's own shape keeps working, and every one of them is a read — none of
//! them moves, writes or decides anything the simulation owns.
//!
//! Each field reads the state's authoritative owner, never a presentation
//! cache. Specifically:
//!
//! - `credits` reads `HouseState::economy`, the single wallet balance, not the
//!   sidebar's smoothed `displayed_credits` (an app-layer presentation value).
//! - `power_*` reads the retained `PowerState` totals, which is what native
//!   queries, not `effective_totals()` (that one applies the trainer's full
//!   power override under `debug-tools`).
//! - `own_entities` reads `GameEntity` identity and health directly. Its
//!   `entity_id` is the entity's stable id, the same id space
//!   `Command::Move { entity_id }` and the other order variants name, so an
//!   agent can hold one across frames.
//! - `is_ground_walkable` reads `Simulation::path_grid`, the current canonical
//!   navigation projection. It is derived from terrain and blocking objects,
//!   and it says nothing about whether a cell is currently occupied: use it
//!   for reachability, not for occupancy.
//! - `owned_by_hand` reads the objects the local player has taken back — the
//!   members of the player's control groups, which live in the local view and
//!   reach this projection through the board (`with_player_groups`) — and the
//!   `TeamClass` scripts of this house. Neither is simulation state the sim
//!   owns: a control group is a promise about a unit the player made, so it
//!   belongs to the player's view, and it is handed in rather than stored.
//!
//! Everything here is integer-valued and iterates in storage order, so a
//! decision built on it stays deterministic.
