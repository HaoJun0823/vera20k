//! Read-only observation, scoped to one house: what that house's player sees.
//!
//! Each field reads the state's authoritative owner, never a presentation
//! cache. Specifically:
//!
//! - `credits` reads `HouseState::economy`, the single wallet balance, not the
//!   sidebar's smoothed `displayed_credits` (an app-layer presentation value).
//! - `power_*` reads the retained `PowerState` totals, which is what native
//!   queries, not `effective_totals()` (that one applies the trainer's full
//!   power override under `debug-tools`).
//! - `own_entities` reads `GameEntity` identity and health directly. Its
//!   `entity_id` is the entity's stable id, the same id space
//!   `Command::Move { entity_id }` and the other order variants name, so an
//!   agent can hold one across frames.
//! - `is_ground_walkable` reads `Simulation::path_grid`, the current canonical
//!   navigation projection. It is derived from terrain and blocking objects,
//!   and it says nothing about whether a cell is currently occupied: use it
//!   for reachability, not for occupancy.
//!
//! Everything here is integer-valued and iterates in storage order, so a
//! decision built on it stays deterministic.
