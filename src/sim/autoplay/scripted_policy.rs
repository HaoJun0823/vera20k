//! The scripted brain: a fixed list of commands released by frame number.
//!
//! It is a schedule, not a plan — it never reads the observation. It exists so
//! the actuation path can be built and tested against something, and it is the
//! simplest thing that can occupy the brain seam. Because its steps are
//! commands rather than goals, it uses the outbox's command channel: the gate
//! (domain switch, budget, ownership, order admission) applies to it exactly as
//! it does to a retail brain's orders, which is the point of keeping it.
