//! The auto play facade: the one type the client holds.
//!
//! Behind it are three layers — [`crate::sim::behavior`] (execute),
//! [`crate::sim::control`] (store, schedule, deliver) and
//! [`crate::sim::strategy`] (decide) — and this file exists so the client never
//! has to know that. The app installs a host, steps it once a frame before the
//! frame drains its commands, and reads a name, a switch and a rejection count
//! for the HUD. Nothing in the client names a layer, a brain or a routine.
//!
//! Keeping the name and the shape is deliberate: a hotkey, a match-state field
//! and an initialiser already speak `AutoPlayHost`, `AutoPlayDomains` and
//! `step`, and the layers under them may be re-arranged without touching any of
//! those three.
