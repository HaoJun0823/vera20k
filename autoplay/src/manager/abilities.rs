//! Abilities: what a unit does with, rather than to, a structure.
//!
//! One file per manager; see `manager/mod.rs`. This one owns the jobs that need
//! a click on a building instead of a click on a cell: capture, garrison,
//! infiltration and transport. The engine already owns every mechanism —
//! `sim::mission::capture` walks the engineer and `sim::movement::per_cell` hands
//! the arrival to the building receiver (`0x00519948`) — so what is missing here
//! is only the decision of *when* and *which*.
//!
//! Nothing in this file names a type. A capturer is any unit whose profile
//! carries [`Roles::ENGINEER`] or [`Roles::AGENT`], and a building worth taking is
//! one the house does not already own.
