//! Things the army must never do, asserted directly.
//!
//! The wish list's play tests report three behaviours that should be impossible
//! rather than merely undesirable:
//!
//! 1. shooting a building the house already owns, after a capture changed hands;
//! 2. shooting something no weapon of ours can hurt — the engine's own `Illegal`
//!    answer, which the policy filters on and which therefore needs a test that
//!    fails if the filter ever stops being consulted;
//! 3. shooting the map's own furniture — a neutral house's structures, which the
//!    projection is supposed to hold apart from enemies on purpose.
//!
//! Each test below builds the smallest arena that exhibits the case and asks the
//! projection, not the policy's opinion of it.
