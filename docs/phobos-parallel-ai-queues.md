# Optional Phobos per-category AI clone limits

Build with `--features phobos` to let a skirmish computer house clone-produce
in parallel except for the categories or TechnoTypes you exclude.

```ini
[GlobalControls]
AllowParallelAIQueues=yes          ; boolean, default yes
ForbidParallelAIQueues.Infantry=no ; boolean
ForbidParallelAIQueues.Vehicle=no  ; boolean
ForbidParallelAIQueues.Navy=no     ; boolean
ForbidParallelAIQueues.Aircraft=no ; boolean
ForbidParallelAIQueues.Building=no ; boolean

[SOMETECHNO]                       ; TechnoType
ForbidParallelAIQueues=false       ; boolean
```

The tags apply unless `AllowParallelAIQueues=no`: Phobos defaults the gate to
yes, and Ares documents `no` as the switch that stops AI cloning. With the gate
on, the first factory building of a category claims the house's slot. A second
building of the same category does not start its own build while that
category's `ForbidParallelAIQueues.<Category>` is set, or while the house's
current choice for that category (`Producing*TypeIndex`) has
`ForbidParallelAIQueues=yes`. A successful exit or an abandonment of a
forbidden category/type releases the slot.

Source: `RulesExt` reads in `src/Ext/Rules/Body.cpp`, the TechnoType read in
`src/Ext/TechnoType/Body.cpp`, and `src/Ext/Building/Hooks.Production.cpp`
(0x4401BB, 0x4502F4, 0x4CA07A, 0x444119, 0x444131, 0x443CCA, 0x44531F).

## Where VERA20K owns it

- `rules/phobos_parallel_ai_queues.rs` — the `[GlobalControls]` reads and the
  category query.
- `rules/ruleset.rs` — projection and configuration hash.
- `rules/object_type.rs` — per-type `ForbidParallelAIQueues=`.
- `sim/ai_base_building.rs` — the per-house factory slot per category.
- `sim/production/factory_ai.rs` — the start gate and the building-exit
  release.
- `sim/production/production_queue.rs` — the unit/infantry/aircraft exit
  prelude release, before FreeRadio and placement retries.
- `sim/production/factory_lifecycle.rs` — the abandonment release.

## Residuals

- VERA does not model Ares' serial mode for `AllowParallelAIQueues=no`: stock
  parallel production stays, and the Phobos excludes only narrow it.
- The type check reads the native `Producing*TypeIndex` choice fields. Builds
  without NPSE keep the vanilla shared Unit choice for land and naval
  factories, so a naval producer's product check uses that shared slot.
- The aircraft free-dock primary-factory reassignment hook (0x4401BB) is
  dormant because VERA has no AI primary-factory switch on full docks.
